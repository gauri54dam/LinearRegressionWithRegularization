# LinearRegressionWithRegularization


Problem Statement :- 

1. Create a custom linear regression model using the house pricing dataset.

 a) Split the dataset into training and test dataset 80:20

 b) Custom linear regression model should be in python class format (Should have init(), predict(), train() methods) and train the model using training dataset

 c) Predict the house prices using test dataset

 d) Show the predicted output, and loss function output plots

 e) Calculate the RMSE and R2 metrics


2. Perform model selection using subset best, forward selection, and backward selection methods 

a) Show your best model features

c) Compare your model performance against the model Q1


3. Regularization 

a) Implement Ridge/Lasso regression for the dataset

b) Compare the lasso/ridge regression model output with Q1, and Q3 models performance metrics

Use RMSE and R2 performance metrics for comparison.
